## Overview
This is my first project Frontend Mentor based on their recommendation for first time users.

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I'm starting out with downloading the project files, unzip them and save it to my Practice directory on my pc.
I'm also initializing the directory as a git repo.
Creating a repo for this project on GitHub and adding it to my local git directory.
I then do an initial first commit to update the project files and a push to Github.

After completing above steps I'm now ready to start planinng my code.
I'm first looking at the designs to understand what components the page is made up of.
I the write the html markup to include all the elements as listed above.

Looking at the design files I'm envisioning a div tag containing an img and two p elements.
I'm also looking to code according to the mobile first workflow as there would be less need later on to alter for mobile.

After adding all the markup I did another commit and then started on the Stylesheet to style the layout, fonts and colors.

There we're still some minore tweakings especially the layout which required the bulk of the work.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned that sometimes a challenge might seem easy at first, but you quickly realize why it's called a challenge once you get into it. I first thought that flexbox would be too obvious a choice to use for this challenge seeing as it's a beginner challenge and flexbox in my mind is a more intermediate topic. However it would seem that the Flex-column layout would prove to be the best course of action to wrap and center all the content.


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com) - I needed to learn more about the hsl color property and found some usefull info on W3Schools website. I've also referenced W3Schools for Flex-center attribute.
- Freecodecamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org) - Freecodecamp came in handy with the google font linking as I had a bit of trouble browsing from google itself.

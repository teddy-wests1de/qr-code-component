## Overview
This is my first project Frontend Mentor based on their recommendation for first time users.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I'm starting out with downloading the project files, unzip them and save it to my Practice directory on my pc.
I'm also initializing the directory as a git repo.
Creating a repo for this project on GitHub and adding it to my local git directory.
I then do an initial first commit to update the project files and a push to Github.

After completing above steps I'm now ready to start planinng my code.
I'm first looking at the designs to understand what components the page is made up of.
I the write the html markup to include all the elements as listed above.

Looking at the design files I'm envisioning a div tag containing an img and two p elements.
I'm also looking to code according to the mobile first workflow as there would be less need later on to alter for mobile.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
